                            <p> So this just happened a couple weeks back, but I've been waiting to see how it ended before sharing. amp#x200B; My old kindle (rest in peace you glorious bastard) had just died, so I was borrowing my wife’s tablet to get my reading fix. I was just chilling out in the cafeteria with a coffee after working a short notice call in (multicar accident) for four hours. Because I was shopping when I got the call I wasn’t in uniform. So it’s just me in an old t-shirt and jeans trying to grab a minute. On Mobile and english is not first language, also TL;DR at bottom So i was out with a friend, we were eating some Kebab from a very nice place in town. We had a great time eating there and felt really nice after it! CET time at 7 pm. And in came a idea in my mind; why dont we start a photographing IG page? We both agreed on it, and decided to find a nice place, where we could take some nice photos and also have a nice time being there too! We did a couple of photos and then took a break. 如果有JRS不知道Quora是啥，嗯，知乎其实就是中国版的Quora。 今天一看推送，来了这么个问题：ltspan id="subject" class="sub_title"gtWhat are some good ways of annoying Chinese people? （有什么好的方法可以激怒中国人？） 下面的回答五花八门，既有中国人作答，也有亚裔乃至老外的回答。 有几条答案还挺有意思，摘了靠前的几条翻译一下。给键委们乐呵乐呵。 所有答案均不代表本人观点，斜体字为本人加注。 原帖地址：lt lt/spangt ltspan id="__w2_yUHljMO_answer_user_sig" class="feed_item_answer_user"gtltspan id="ld_kufkme_97584"gtlta href="http://www.quo. So, this was my first solo build and it was a lot harder then what I thought. I ended up having to mount my Rad upside down and hammer flat the top part of the front mount and drill holes to match up to the rad. I also must rotate the CPU cooler block by 90 degrees as the tubs were getting in the way of the ram. Then my corsair fans gave me a run for my money as I had to find a way to run the Nod Pro as I only had 2 internal USB ports so I have to run an external power cable DANI TIMELINE I am SO SORRY for the format. I wrote all of this in Word and can't seem to make it look nice here. September 2016 Floyd Galloway Jr attacks a woman in Hines Park. He drags her into a wooded area and attempts to rape her. She manages to escape, flag down a passing car, and use the motorist’s phone to call 911. December 1, 2016 Dani posts a watercolor she made of herself on Instagram. This is her last known social media post. December Literally was down and out today sicker than hell, recently had gotten laid off so no money coming in figured I should stop grabbing for a little till I get back on my feet. Well the dgirl must have felt bad for me the other day when I told her this so she calls me today and litteraly lists off like 50 or so things she will trade for a few bags!!! I could not fucking believe it.from the girl who won't let me slide on 5$ literally just took two old Samsung tablets that I never fucking 
(Questions amp TLDR at the bottom) I'm a console gamer making the switch to PC gaming. In November, I spent some time on r/buildapc and r/buildapcsales researching and revising my build. Over the course of a couple weeks, I bought the parts (or close equivalents) as they went on sale. The parts were all in as of a couple weeks ago but I didn't want to start the build until after my semester was over to avoid distractions (my last final was yesterday). Looking forward to the build really carri. Just another usual day in the house of Marga: She received a text from her airbnb clients, telling her that the wind had blown down the outside table, damaging it. Now she's going to hold back their 500€ security deposit, until she's replaced the table. THE PROBLEM is, the outside table. Is a typical plastic unsteady thing with the 4 legs coming off easily. Something similar to this (https://www.google.fr/search?q=outside+plastic+table+for+6ampclient=ms-android-samsungampprmd=isvnampso. Jasmine laid in her bed, sleeping relatively peacefully when she was awoken suddenly by this weird feeling. Sitting up, she looked around the room, it felt like someone was there but she saw no one. Suddenly a rather large spider crawled out of the shadow by her dresser and began walking towards her, the telltale black mists pouring off its body up towards the ceiling. Smiling she sat up in her bed, waiving her had as though beckoning it to come over to her. It would The Lenovo Miix 510 really is a tablet with removable keyboard dock but gives the majority of the characteristics you would expect from the full-sized notebook. The performance is on par with most mainstream notebooks, it features a decent IPS touch panel, superior keyboard, compact and usable touchpad but fails to handle a number of our issues with regards to battery lifestyle, cooling capabilities and connectivity.Still, the trade-offs could not be described as a deal-breakers for many custome. 
###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yes. What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. Gaming and various programming (just starting to learn, so don't know the specific area of focus yet). (And the obvious casual internet usage). If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings) 60FPS, 1080p, high to ultra. feels kinda unfair that you get a rare skin for playing on a specific platform like playstation or samsung. maybe each one is some sort of nod to the platform itself. A glue stick, one empty can of Pepsi, and a stapler. That is what came in the small brown package yesterday afternoon. The glue stick is still full but half of the plastic case is broken off, the can of Pepsi is crushed into a small metal pancake, and the stapler is covered in blood. Before I confuse you too much, let me tell you how this shit storm started. About two weeks ago, I walked into the electronics store I worked at to pick up the new Samsung tablet I had my eye on for a while. 
This might sound extremely bratty and terrible but I’m glad I can share something. And maybe someone will come across this someday, and read it with an open mind. I’m in a Brooklyn middle school in NYC, and my parents are turning 60. I was born more than twenty one years after my brother, who’s almost in his forties, and I hate that my family isn’t normal. My brother is married and has two kids, but he cut himself from our parents and lives separately. His wife, my sister in law, wishes Hi all! ampnbsp; I've had my PC for over 5 years now, it was built for me by an ex boyfriend and I hadn't upgraded any part of it in the last few years. However, I want to future proof it a little more (though she's still running well! I'm pretty happy with it, but I do notice it falling behind in a lot of games) and have a plan to swap out some parts. Note: Prices are in AUD, my budget isn't massive but I feel like it's enough for right now. Please be patient with me, i'm not great So Ive decided on the parts and was wondering if my fellow redditors could help a noob out with his first build. (And first time posting anything on Reddit btw lol) \ gulp\ The parts ive chosen: MOBO: Gigabyte Z370 AORUS Gaming 5 CPU: Core i7 8700K GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 TI Founders Edition COOLING: NZXT Kraken x72 360mm AIO RAM: Corsair 16GB DDR4 (2x8gb) PSU: Corsair 750W 80 Plus Gold Power Supply SSD: Samsung 500GB SSD 860 EVO HDD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 3.5in CASE:. -No, samsung, I don't want to live longer. -No, get the damn kale out of my face -You bet your ass that I'm still gonna be drinking that coffee, heart rate of 130?? Pfft, I'm fine. -Awe great, met my step goal, alright, I'll have a McDouble with fries. No, no cheese, I'm on a diet. -Ayeee! 30 pounds down! That's like 120 quarter pounders.yes, I'll get a shake with that, no cheese on the burger though, I'm on a roll with this. -No, theres abs under the rolls, I swear. -It doesn't count I was looking for a certain AOC monitor to compliment the one I already have for a dual monitor set up. It's sold out from the store I previously bought from so I check other nearby ones. I go in to this pretty large retail chain and tell one of the salesmen I'm looking for this monitor. He tells me they don't have it but he'd like to show me what they have and I agree. On the way he tells me the specs; a PLS panel, 4ms, and Freesync and says that the Freesync technology is great. Sounds Following suggestion (https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/905zla/how_durable_are_bose_soundsport_wireless/) from /r/headphones I've decided to ask for an advice. Like mentioned in the attached thread I'm looking for decent wireless (not truly free though) headphones at range up to 250 euros (cheaper would be nice though). At first I wanted to go for Bose Soundsport Wireless but maybe there is in fact something better at that price. Budget - Around 200 euros Source/Amp. 
So i broke my old Samsung S6 during the weekend ( the phone i used to play rivals on) I got a new S9+ to play and when downloading the game i seem to have lost all my progress and i am required to start over it seems. Am i missing something to link the accounts maybe? It was not that much progress lost. i was just a bit over 600 GDI and 300 NOD since i had only just started playing, but i did put some work into it and would love to get my account and IGN back. If there is a community person. S County T is a lonely stretch of country road. The kind of road that one would never expect to find anything remotely interesting. Specially not a gas station. Luckily for Hank Spitzer, there was one, and it was open 24/7. The low fuel light was glowing yellow inside the gray 2006 Mercury Sable, and the torrential downpour raging on around it continued as he slowly hit the brakes and pulled into the parking lot. The big, dimly lit neon sign above the run-down station read, Zippy Fill. ###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yup! What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better. Gaming and to hang with the cool kids in the 1440p lounge. If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings) 2560 x 1440 120hz (Could I 240hz on this?) High settings on Witcher 3, Pubg, Sea of thieves and whatever is to come. 
Hello reddit, This is not your usual copy/paste console peasant cringe. These are some things that I heard from many people and that I find very funny and computer related. Here goes: 1) This one was some time in 2007. My friend's brother: My computer got a virus. Me: How so? You don't have internet. What happens when you turn your computer on? My friend's brother: Well, you see, when I turn it on, it shows up windows logo and then virus shows me some blue screen with white This happened a few weeks back, on an otherwise quiet day. A man comes into my department while I'm settling in at the start of my shift. I greet him while I clean up the register a bit and he ignores me to just browse the TVs we have on display. After a couple of minutes he speaks up to get my attention. Occupied with some sensitive documents, I turn to help him. He'll be C, I'll be Me: gt C: How big is this TV? pointing to a 60'' set gt Me: That one is a 60'' Samsung. gt C: Fifty?. </p>
